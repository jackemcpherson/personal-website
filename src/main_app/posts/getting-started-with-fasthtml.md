# Getting Started with FastHTML

FastHTML is an exciting new web framework for Python that aims to simplify web development while providing powerful features for building modern applications. In this post, I'll walk you through the basics of getting started with FastHTML.

## What Makes FastHTML Special?

FastHTML stands out for several reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: Build web apps with minimal boilerplate code
2. **Python-native**: No need to learn templating languages - write everything in Python
3. **Fast**: Optimized for performance with smart caching and efficient rendering
4. **Modern**: Built-in support for modern web standards and practices

## Installation

Getting started is as simple as installing the package:

```bash
pip install python-fasthtml
```

Or if you're using `uv` (which I highly recommend):

```bash
uv add python-fasthtml
```

## Your First FastHTML App

Here's a minimal FastHTML application:

```python
from fasthtml.common import *

app = FastHTML()

@app.get("/")
def home():
    return Html(
        Head(Title("My First App")),
        Body(
            H1("Welcome to FastHTML!"),
            P("This is my first FastHTML application.")
        )
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

## Key Concepts

### Components as Functions

In FastHTML, HTML elements are represented as Python functions:

```python
def welcome_section():
    return Section(
        H2("Welcome"),
        P("This is a reusable component"),
        cls="welcome-section"
    )
```

### Route Handlers

Route handlers return HTML structures directly:

```python
@app.get("/profile/{user_id}")
def profile(user_id: int):
    return Html(
        Head(Title(f"Profile - User {user_id}")),
        Body(
            H1(f"User Profile: {user_id}"),
            P("Profile content here...")
        )
    )
```

### Static Files

Serving static files is straightforward:

```python
app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")
```

## Building This Blog

This very blog you're reading was built with FastHTML! The architecture includes:

- **Content Management**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Middleware that injects recent posts into all pages
- **Tag System**: Automatic tag extraction and filtering
- **Responsive Design**: CSS that adapts to different screen sizes

The content parsing pipeline looks like this:

```python
def load_post(slug: str) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
    """Load a specific blog post by its slug."""
    posts_dir = _get_posts_directory()
    file_path = posts_dir / f"{slug}.md"
    
    if not file_path.exists():
        return None
        
    with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        post = frontmatter.load(f)
    
    md = markdown.Markdown(extensions=["codehilite", "fenced_code"])
    html_content = md.convert(post.content)
    
    return {
        "slug": slug,
        "title": post.metadata.get("title", "Untitled"),
        "date": post.metadata.get("date"),
        "tags": post.metadata.get("tags", []),
        "content": html_content,
    }
```

## Next Steps

FastHTML is still evolving, but it's already powerful enough to build production applications. Some areas to explore next:

- Database integration with SQLModel or SQLAlchemy
- User authentication and sessions
- Real-time features with WebSockets
- API development with automatic OpenAPI documentation
